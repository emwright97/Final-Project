# Final-Project
This experiement is studying the connection between Nighttime light and GDP in the United States

# Prerequisites
What is needed to install the software needed is a functional computer with enough storage space

# Installing
Things we need to install are jupyter notebook, azure machine learning studio, and ArcPro

# Running the tests
Tests will be run on Jupyter notebook to recieve the zonal statistics for both Nighttime light and population in the United States
Once recieveing these zonal statistics results, they will be imported into CSVs. 
The CSVs. will then be imported into Azure Machine Learning studio
I have also downloaded sub-national GDP data 
Then on Azure Machine Learning Studio I will study the relationship between GDP and Nighttime light
